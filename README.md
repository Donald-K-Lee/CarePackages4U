# About
CarePackages4U is a web application that my team and I created during a XDHacks Mini-Covid, hosted on June 6th-June 7th in 2020. 
<br />
<br />
     CarePackages4U is an easily accessible web application that allows anyone who is unable to leave their houses to request their needs in a list. Local volunteers, donors, food banks, or charities can then view their list in the homepage, contact them, then set up a plan for delivering the needs for them.
